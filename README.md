# VideoSearch
Uses google's youtube api to take a users search from the input and return a list of videos that can be played in the browser

The application is not all that complicated but was created to help solidify core React concepts such as classes, state, props, communicating from child to parents,
callback functions, etc.
It also helped me better understand the design process behind creating react apps and the importance of components and keeping everything organized so that the code
is clear, concise and reusable.

To run the application:

- Download the folder onto your machine and then navigate to it in the terminal.
- Use NPM start to run the application and navigate to your designated local host port and its ready to go.
